                  <h2>Physical and Behavioral Observation</h2>            
                  <p> Dr. Alice McLennan - This young girl seems to be dealing with issues at home. As of now we are unaware of these issues, but hope to find them through conducting more tests.
Although she seemed to be motivated to work at first she soon became easily put off by others, and therefore demotivated. She became easily frustrated when she was unable to do something. She preferred being by herself and working alone.
Frequently comments include “who are you?” “Don’t touch me” and “I want to be alone”.

                  <h2>Test Results and Interpretation</h2> 
                  <h3>A. Intellectual Functioning</h3>
                  <p>Kate was not able to respond to any part of the verbal test and in most parts of the performance test. She stared at the wall and appeared to be talking to herself.  It was noted, however, that she could name familiar objects shown in pictures, such as man, woman, fox, elephant. Her verbal functioning is weaker than her performance functioning.</p>

Kate is becoming more talkative each session. She mentions a friend of hers named Josie, Her parents do not know of a girl named Josie.
